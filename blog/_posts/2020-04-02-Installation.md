##### Introduction to Matlab 2018b

Matlab, integrated with other languages, enables you to deploy algorithms and applications in the Web, enterprise and production systems. Compared with matlab2018a, matlab2018b possesses more data analysis, machine learning and deep learning options, and the speed is faster than ever. Highlights include enhanced deep learning to better view the design and build your own models, network training and visualization, and the latest features deployed. 

Optimized Simulink intelligent editing, click to create a new module port, and edit the module parameters directly on the icon. The 5G Toolbox can simulate, analyze and test the physical layer of 5G communication systems, and is suitable for engineering calculations, control design, signal processing and communication, image processing, signal detection, financial modeling design and analysis and many other fields.

Finally, we declare that this is an open version of matlab and commercial use is prohibited.

##### 1. Download the installation package

Before we start the installation, download the installation package and the crack tools firstly.
